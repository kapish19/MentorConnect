# MentorConnect
The College Mentor Allocation System is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to facilitate the assignment of junior students to faculties, based on their department, academic interests, and career goals. The system allows students to register and create profiles by providing key details such as their area of study, interests, and future aspirations. Once registered, students are paired with mentors who align with their academic and professional objectives. The platform ensures that students receive personalized guidance and mentorship from seniors who can offer relevant advice and support. It also features an event registration module where students can view and register for upcoming mentorship events, providing opportunities for offline or online interactions with mentors in a structured environment.
In addition to mentor allocation, the system allows students to update their profiles with new interests or goals as their academic journey progresses. It also includes an anonymous feedback feature where students can review their mentoring experience, helping the administration monitor mentor performance and improve the program continuously. The event registration aspect plays a key role, encouraging students to actively participate in mentorship-driven activities like workshops or networking sessions, enhancing their learning experience beyond regular mentor meetings. This holistic approach ensures a streamlined and effective mentorship process that benefits both juniors and mentors, fostering meaningful academic relationships.
